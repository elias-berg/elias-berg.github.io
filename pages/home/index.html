  <h1>Welcome to Eli's Site</h1>
  <p>This site was designed using basic JavaScript and only jQuery. The intention is to keep it as minimalistic as possible, while trying to <i>feel</i> like a Single Page Application.</p>
  <p>It's a work in progress, but is meant as an ongoing personal project to explore and utilize various facets of frontend code.</p>
  <p>As of writing this page, I'm using Github Pages for its simplicity and no need for a backend.</p>

  <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><h4>My official resume</h4></li>
    <li><h4>A fun, little blog</h4></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Keep in mind I'm updating the site as I come up with new ideas, so who knows what will appear next!</p>
