        "I've decided to start a personal blog to document my random adventures in both the real world and code.",
        "I was inspired to start this personal blog after an otherwise ordinary daily standup meeting.",
        "We were going over a design for some new development to work on when part of the design indicated development that was reminiscient of a serious issue we faced in the code before.",
        "Namely, a data import spreadsheet was meant to allow users to import \"role\" data based on the role <i>name</i>...",
        "My fellow developers may immediately think, \"But what if the role name changes?!\". Well, exactly.",
        "So, naturally, I made the joke, \"There are Greek Mythologies that warn about this approach!\".",
        "Everyone laughed. It was a good time. But really, there are mistakes we seem to make again and again, especially in code.",
        "Hence, I'm using this blog partly as a creative outlet for some of these stories, partly for the fun of it!",
        "This blog, itself, is also a development project since I'm writing the entire site from scratch, so apologies if it's buggy or not mobile optimized...",
        "But otherwise, hope you enjoy!"
